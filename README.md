# AG CFD Saver
The AG CFD Saver is a microservice responsible for Cumulative Flow Diagram generation. It was written 100% in python and uses AIOHTTP client/server framework in the base.

## Install
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
There are two ways to start the server:
1 - Enter into the cfd directory and execute the command below:
`python server.py`

2 - Enter into the cfd directory and use the devtools:
`adev runserver --port 8080`

The main difference between these two ways is that the second is better to the development because it has resources like debug mode and live reload.

There is a simple endpoint that generates the CFD.
